# ⚙️ How It Works

## 1️⃣ User Joins

When the application starts, users are presented with a **Join Screen**.

They simply enter a username and join the chat.

The username becomes their identity during the current session.

---

## 2️⃣ Socket Connection

Once inside the chat,

the client establishes a **persistent Socket.IO connection** with the Node.js server.

Unlike traditional HTTP requests,

this connection stays alive throughout the session.

---

## 3️⃣ Sending Messages

Whenever the user types a message,

the application emits a Socket.IO event containing:

- Username
- Message
- Reply information (if available)
- Message ID

The server receives this event immediately.

---

## 4️⃣ Broadcasting

The server broadcasts the message to every connected client.

Every browser instantly receives the event.

No refresh is required.

---

## 5️⃣ Rendering Messages

Each connected client:

- Creates a new chat bubble
- Displays sender name
- Displays message
- Displays reply preview (if replying)
- Automatically scrolls to latest message

All users remain synchronized.

---

## 6️⃣ Reply Feature

Users can reply to any message.

Desktop:

- Click Reply button

Mobile:

- Long press the message

The selected message appears above the input box,

allowing contextual conversations.

# 🚀 Getting Started

## Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/just-prem22/global-chat-project.git
```

---

## Navigate to Project

```bash
cd global-chat-project
```

---

## Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

---

## Run Server

```bash
node server.js
```

---

## Open Browser

Visit

```text
http://localhost:3000
```

Open multiple browser tabs to simulate multiple users.

---

# 💬 Reply System

The reply system allows users to reference previous messages.

Instead of sending only plain text,

each reply stores:

- Original Sender
- Original Message

When rendered,

the application displays a small preview above the new message,

creating threaded conversations similar to modern messaging applications.

---

# 📱 Responsive Design

The interface has been designed to work across multiple devices.

Desktop:

- Hover reply button
- Large chat window
- Optimized spacing

Mobile:

- Long press reply
- Larger touch targets
- Optimized message width
- Better scrolling behavior

---

---

# 🌐 Client–Server Communication

Unlike traditional web applications where every action requires an HTTP request,

Socket.IO creates a persistent connection between the client and server.

```text
Traditional Website

Client
   │
HTTP Request
   │
Server
   │
HTTP Response
   ▼
Connection Closed


Global Chat Project

Client
   │
Socket Connection
   │
Server
   │
Connection Remains Open
   │
Real-Time Communication
```

This allows messages to appear instantly without refreshing the page.

# 🔐 Security Considerations

This project is intended for educational purposes.

Current implementation does **not** include:

- User Authentication
- Password Protection
- Database Storage
- Message Encryption
- Rate Limiting
- Spam Protection
- User Sessions

These features can be added in future versions.

---

# 🚀 Performance

The project is intentionally lightweight.

Benefits include:

- Fast startup
- Low memory usage
- Instant communication
- Minimal dependencies
- Simple deployment
- Easy to understand codebase

Because Socket.IO only transfers events,

communication remains efficient even with multiple connected users.

---
